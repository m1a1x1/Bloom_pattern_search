There are two python programs:

  - bloom_model.py - python model of Bloom pattern search algorithm.

  - util_for_sim.py - program for making a settings file for
                      simulation.

Description of programs:

 bloom_model.py 
  
   The keys:

     ATTENTION: All keys must be set!

     -s <FILE_NAME> - File with strings for search (e.c. example_strings).

     -d <FILE_NAME> - File, in which search will be done.

     -o <FILE_NAME> - Output file name (if not set - "filtered_data").
             
     -h             - help.

   How to work with it:

     1) Make you own file with strings (use "example_strings" as the
     example)

     2) Make you own file with data, where you want to search.

     3) Run:

          python bloom_model.py -s example_strings -d example_data -o example_filt_data

     4) In the end you will see, true result and result of Bloom
        filter.

     5) Also output file will appear with strings without patterns.



 util_for_sim.py

   The keys:

     ATTENTION:  1) You can set only one key at a time.
                 2) You can change .json file name and file for
                 simulation with strings. Open util_for_sim.py and
                 change values of SIM_FNAME and PM_STATE_FNAME.

     -i             - Initialasing of module, always start with this
                      command.
                      
                         util_for_sim.py -i

     -a <STRING>    - Add 1 string <STRING> as a pattern for search.

     -A <FILE_NAME> - Add all strings from file <FILE_NAME> as a
                      patterns for search.

     -r <STRING>    - Remove <STRING> from list of patterns for search.

     -S             - Show info.
  
   How to work with it:
   
     1) Initialasing module:

          python util_for_sim.py -i

     2) Add 1 string:
 
          python util_for_sim.py -a google

        Or list of strings:

          python util_for_sim.py -A example_strings

     3) In the end you will have example_settings file with settings
        for simulation. Copy this file in ../testbench/
