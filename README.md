## About
Verilog model of Bloom filter pattern search with opportunity to test
it on your text files!

Input: 1) File with long strings for cheking patterns there.<br/>
       2) Spetial file for writing patterns in memory.<br/>

Output: 1) Transcript of ModelSim.<br/>
        2) Special file with search results.<br/>

In every file you will finde detailed instructions
and descriptions.

## How to make it work:

  1) Read ./doc/README for general information about project.<br/>
  2) Follow the instructions ./py_utils/README and create settings<br/>
     file for simulation.<br/>
  3) Follow the instructions ./testbench/README and run simulation.<br/> 

## The necessary software

  1) ModelSim (See mode in ./doc/README )<br/>

## P.S.

Hope you will found it usefull!
