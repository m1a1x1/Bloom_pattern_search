In this folder there are all parts of bloom filter.
Main file is top_bloom.sv

All modules are in SystemVerilog.

You can change parameters in top_bloom.sv

Modules:

  bloom_rx

    Input:

      - data_i     [7:0]  - Data for search. 1 byte per clock cycle.

      - data_eop_i        - Strobe, show the end of string for search.

      - data_val_i        - Data valid signal. Can not fall without
                            eop strobe. 

   How it works:
     
      Module make a queue with input data with the length of MAX_S.

   Output:

      - data_o     [MAX_S-1:0][7:0]  - Queue of input data.

      - data_eop_o                   - Delayed eop.

      - data_val_o [MAX_S-1:0]       - Data valid signal.

  crc32_hash 

    Input:

      - symbs_data_i     [MAX_S-1:0][7:0]  - Data for calculating hash.
     
      - symbs_data_val_i [MAX_S-1:0]       - Data valid signal.

    How it works:

      Module calculate 10 hash-functions from BF_N simbols:

        - Calculate 4 crc32 with different polynoms.

        - Combain results and seporate it in 10 hashes each 12-bit width.
          
    Output:

      - hash_o [HASH_CNT-1:0][HASH_WIDTH-1:0]  - 10 hash-functions
                                                 12-bit width.
                                                 
      - hash_val_o                             - Data valid signal.

  bloommem

    Input:

      - hash_i [HASH_CNT-1:0][HASH_WIDTH-1:0]  - Hash-function results
                                                 (used as an addres
                                                 for memory)

      - hash_val_i                             - Data valid signal.

      - bsi                                    - Intrface for writing
                                                 new strings in
                                                 memory.

    How it works:

      If there are logic 1 in memory with addres hash_i - this strings
      might be written. If in all 10 adresses there are logic 1 -
      we cosider that exactly wthis string was written.

      Module is ready to write new string while searching (it will be
      written right after search done).

      Module does not count strings written. Python module have to do
      it for it.

    Output:

      - match_o     - Search result.

      - long_clr_o  - Statuse of full memory cleaning.
